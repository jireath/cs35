on these answers.

1. What is your name?  What do you prefer to be called?
   My name is Jimmy Nguyen and I have no preference on what I prefer to be called.


2. Why are you taking CS35?
   I'm taking CS35 because I am interested in pursing a Computer Science minor along
   with a Cognitive Science major with a concentration in Artificial Intelligence.

3. What is your previous experience in Computer Science?  What
programming languages do you know, and which classes have you taken?
   I've taken CS21 last semester and at the moment I only know python3.


4. These are a couple questions about how you approach your assignments.

  a. Do you start on your homework as soon as it is assigned or do you
  tend to finish it right before it's due?
  I like to start when it is assigned, maybe not do a lot of it, but I like to
  make sure that I at least have started some of it so it isn't too stressful
  later on.
  
  
  b. When doing group work, do you prefer for your group to split your
  work up into pieces or do you like to work together as a group
  through as much of the material as possible?
  I enjoy both really sometimes I like to split up and work on different sections
  and come together and explain what we did, and other times when I don't want
  to work alone or the work seems especially daunting I'd like to work through
  the material together to have multiple brains tackling it.


5. What do you consider fun?
   For me anything can be fun! I just have to think of it as fun. But generally
   speaking I enjoy just hanging out with people and also having my alone time
   where I play games, read, watch shows, etc.
